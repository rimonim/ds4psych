## Parallelograms {#sec-parallelograms}

Introduced with word2vec by @mikolov_etal_2013

Glove [@pennington_etal_2014] is designed with this property in mind. Transformer models are not.

In CCR, for example, there’s a difference between agreeing with statements in a questionnaire and actually writing like a questionnaire. How do I know that I’m measuring how anxious/depressed the comments are and not how questionnaire-y they are?
Potential workaround: reverse all of the statements in the questionnaire (as for reverse-coded items), add them to the original questionnaire, and get the average embedding of the construct-neutral questionnaire. Then subtract this embedding from the original questionnaire average embedding.

@chersoni_etal_2021 used partial least squares regression to map distributional embeddings to human-rated semantic features derived from research in cognitive psychology.
