This is the website for **Data Science for Psychology**. 

This book will teach you state-of-the-art methods for analyzing psychological properties of text, and will cover the fundamentals of data visualization, data collection, and scientific methodology necessary to produce meaningful work in the field.

At every step of the way, we will give examples in **R**, using the tools and rules of the **tidyverse**. This book will also teach you the basics of the **quanteda** and **text** packages for natural language processing (NLP), and the **vosonSML** package for collecting data from popular social media sites.

Unless otherwise noted, all figures in this book were generated by us using **ggplot2**. The full, reproducible code for their generation can be viewed by clicking the "View Source" button at the bottom of each page.
