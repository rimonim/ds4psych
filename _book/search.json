    "text": "There are no objective rules for how to make a good data visualization. This is because not all data visualizations have the same purpose.\nHere are three common purposes for data visualization:\n\nGetting a quick, intuitive understanding of the data you are working with\nLooking for aspects of your data that common statistics might miss (like outliers or nonlinear relationships)\nCommunicating something to people who don’t have a deep understanding of your data\n\nThe first two purposes are an important aspects of exploratory data analysis (EDA). They will be discussed in Chapter 12. The third one - communication - is the topic of this unit.\nCommunication is hard. It is especially hard for scientists, who often need to balance the needs of multiple target audiences. While insiders in a particular field may want detailed, objective analysis of results and the uncertainty surrounding them, everyone else wants a story.\nA story is clear, oversimplified and sensational. Stories are what grab people’s attention and hold it. Even for experts, stories are what make one study (or news article, or social media post) stand out among many. If you tell a good story, people will want to learn more about the details. If you don’t tell a good story, nobody will want to read your supplementary materials. In this way, all scientists are journalists."

    "title": "1  Choose Your Aesthetics Carefully",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For most people, aesthetics is the art of making things pleasant to look at. To the data visualizer though, “aesthetics” means something much more precise: Aesthetics are the visual representation of variables.\nJust as journalists need to decide which words to use to express their ideas, data visualizers need to decide which aesthetics to use to express their variables.\nThere are many options. Below are six different ways to represent the numbers “1”, “2”, and “3”, each mapping them to a different aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a concrete example. Eichstaedt et al. (2015) collected Twitters posts from 935 U.S. counties, and counted the number of words related to positive emotions. This emotional measure could then be connected with known demographic measures of each county, such as race and average income.\n\nhead(twitter_counties)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   county   state income posEmotions maj                        \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      \n#&gt; 1 Autauga  AL     55165     0.00549 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n#&gt; 2 Baldwin  AL     50006     0.00670 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n#&gt; 3 Blount   AL     43450     0.00336 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n#&gt; 4 Butler   AL     29769     0.00407 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n#&gt; 5 Calhoun  AL     38473     0.00448 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n#&gt; 6 Chambers AL     30546     0.00523 Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\n\nThere are many ways to present this information graphically. Each choice emphasizes a different aspect of the data, and tells a different story.\nIn the following visualization,\n\nincome is mapped to the “x” position aesthetic\nposEmotions (positive emotions) is mapped to the “y” position aesthetic\nmaj (racial majority) is mapped to the color aesthetic\n\n\nlibrary(ggborderline) # for making the lines pop\n\ntwitter_counties %&gt;% \n  ggplot(\n    aes(income, posEmotions, \n        # rearrange the categorical variable so that the order in the legend matches the order in the plot\n        color = factor(maj, levels = c(\"Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\", \"Majority Hispanic\", \"Majority Black\")))\n    ) +\n    # scatterplot\n    geom_point(alpha = .5, \n               # draw sample such that the \"Majority Non-Black/Hispanic\" points don't overpower the others\n               data = twitter_counties %&gt;% group_by(maj) %&gt;% slice_sample(n = 100)) +\n    # loess regression\n    stat_smooth(aes(bordercolor = after_scale(colorspace::darken(color))), # borders that match the lines, but are slightly darker\n                se = FALSE, geom = \"borderline\", linewidth = 1, lineend = \"square\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    # nicer color palette\n    scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\", direction = -1) +\n    # proper formatting for income\n    scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +\n    labs(x = \"County Average Income\",\n         y = \"Positive Emotional Words in Twitter Posts\\n(proportion of total words)\",\n         color = \"\")\n\n\n\n\nThis is the most intuitive way to organize the three variables. By mapping income to the x axis, we lightly suggest that it is the cause of whatever is happening on the y axis - in this case positive emotion. The idea that higher income causes positive emotion is intuitive - many people believe they would be happier with a higher income. People accustomed to languages that are written left-to-right, like English, will tend to think about what happens as they move left to right on the graph. Three LOESS regression lines encourage the viewer to compare the slopes of the three color groups, which they will go through from top to bottom:\n\nIn counties without a Black or Hispanic majority, greater income means more positive emotion, up to about $60,000 a year, when the line starts flattening out.\nIn counties with a majority Hispanic population, greater income means dramatically more positive emotion, on average.\nIn counties with a majority Black population, greater income doesn’t seem to make much of a difference.\n\nBut just because this scheme is the most intuitive does not mean it is the best one.\nThe next visualization shows the same data but tells a different story. This one also has x, y, and color, but they are mapped to the variables differently:\n\nincome is binned and mapped to the “x” position aesthetic\nmaj (racial majority) is mapped to the “y” position aesthetic\nposEmotions (positive emotions) is mapped to the “fill” color aesthetic\n\n\ntwitter_counties %&gt;% \n  # hand-made bins (note the inconsistent bin width to give more space to the center of the distribution) \n  mutate(income = factor( case_when(income &gt; 100000 ~ \"$100,000+\",\n                                    income &gt; 80000 ~ \"$80,000-$100,000\",\n                                    income &gt; 60000 ~ \"$60,000-$80,000\",\n                                    income &gt; 50000 ~ \"$50,000-$60,00\",\n                                    income &gt; 40000 ~ \"$40,000-$50,00\",\n                                    .default = \"$20,000-$40,00\"),\n                          levels = c(\"$20,000-$40,00\", \n                                     \"$40,000-$50,00\",\n                                     \"$50,000-$60,00\", \n                                     \"$60,000-$80,000\",\n                                     \"$80,000-$100,000\",\n                                     \"$100,000+\"))) %&gt;% \n  # aggregate by the new bins\n  group_by(income, maj) %&gt;% \n  summarise(posEmotions = mean(posEmotions, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(income, maj, fill = posEmotions)) +\n    # tiles with a little bit of space in between\n    geom_tile(width = .95, height = .95) +\n    # minimal theme\n    theme_minimal() +\n    # color scale to emphasize differences between extremes\n    scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"green\", high = \"yellow\", midpoint = .0055) +\n    labs(x = \"County Average Income\",\n         y = \"\",\n         fill = \"Positive Emotional Words\\nin Twitter Posts\\n(proportion of total words)\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1), # angles x axis text to fit it all in\n          axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n          legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) +\n    # constrain the tiles to be perfectly square\n    coord_equal()\n\n\n\n\nUsing fill makes it harder to see the slope within each racial group, and easier to see the differences between them. The vertical ordering from most positive emotion (in majority non-Black/Hispanic counties) to least positive emotion (majority Black counties) emphasizes this even more. The blank squares on the grid also make the point that there are no majority Black or Hispanic counties with average incomes above $80,000.\nLet’s try one more way to present these data. In this visualization,\n\nincome is mapped to the “y” position aesthetic\nposEmotions (positive emotions) is mapped to the “color” aesthetic\nmaj (racial majority) is mapped to the “x” position aesthetic\n\n\ntwitter_counties %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(maj, income, fill = posEmotions)) +\n    # sina plot\n    ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(aes(color = after_scale(colorspace::darken(fill, .3))), alpha = .5, method = \"pseudorandom\", shape = 21, varwidth = TRUE) +\n    # color scheme which maximizes the visibility of different values among the crowd (this is a losing battle)\n    scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"red\", mid = \"white\", high = \"blue\", midpoint = .005) +\n    # unintrusive theme\n    theme_bw() +\n    # log scale, and proper formatting for income\n    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(), trans = \"log10\") +\n    labs(x = \" \",\n         y = \"County Average Income\",\n         fill = \"Positive Emotional Words\\nin Twitter Posts\\n(proportion of total words)\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nThis is a sina plot (also known as a beeswarm plot), in which point clouds are arranged by a continuous variable on one axis, a categorical variable on the other axis, and spread out in proportion to their density along the spaces in between the categories.\nSina plots are a good way to compare distributions of different groups (they are almost always more informative than box plots or violin plots); this plot emphasizes that counties with a majority Black population tend to have relatively low average incomes. The other story that this plot tells is the uneven sizes of the three groups - by separating out the points in each group, this visualization emphasizes the fact that there are very few US counties with majority Black or Hispanic population.\nThis plot makes it very difficult to learn anything about positive emotion in Twitter posts. The colors themselves give some guidance: the white in the middle of the scale suggests that it represents some sort of zero point - a “normal” amount of positive emotion. Nevertheless, the viewer will have to squint in order to notice the trend for higher income counties to be happier. The emotional variable is not adding much to this visualization.\nIn this section we have seen how choices about which aesthetics to map to variables make a big difference in the way a data visualization is interpreted. Three visualization of the same data can emphasize tell very different stories. Some of these stories are interesting and some of them are not.\n\nPress the “View Source” button below to see the hidden code blocks in this section.\n\n\n\n\nEichstaedt, J. C., Schwartz, H.

    "section": "2.1 A Small, Compelling Story is Better Than a Big, Confusing One",
    "text": "2.1 A Small, Compelling Story is Better Than a Big, Confusing One\nSchwartz (2013) collected 15.4 million Facebook status updates from participants who had filled out a variety of questionnaires on the My Personality application (discussed in Chapter 5). They analyzed the frequencies of millions of words, phrases, and topics as they correlate with gender, age, and personality traits of the author. The resulting paper focused on methodology, but Schwartz (2013) nevertheless understood the importance of telling a good story. Here is their figure 5B:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a beautiful data visualization. The story it tells is so clear and simple that it doesn’t need a caption: Older people use “I” less and “we” more. The unstated implication is either that people get less individualistic with age, or that the young people of today are self-centered. Both are excellent stories.\nHow did Schwartz et al. achieve such a clear story? Let’s take a closer look at some of their choices:\nFirst, out of millions of words, phrases, and topics in their analysis, they chose to focus this visualization on only two. This is the first step of story-telling with data: remove distractions. A small, compelling story is better than a big, confusing one.\nSecond, they chose not to show the data points themselves, but to represent the overall trends with regression lines. This is a major sacrifice, since it makes the graph much less informative - any good scientist will wonder about the distributions surrounding these lines: How rare are community-oriented 20-year-olds? What about self-centered 60-year-olds? Nevertheless, Schwartz et al. decided that including a scatter plot behind the lines would make the graph to confusing to look at, and distract from the main story.\nThird, they chose to use bendy LOESS regression lines, even though the main analysis of the paper was conducted with linear regression. This was a great choice because it makes the story more convincing. The fact that even LOESS lines show near-linear trends is impressive. Even though there are no data points to be seen, those steady lines give the impression that the underlying data are reliable. Also, the the LOESS lines give the viewer the opportunity to notice nuances in the story without distracting from the big picture (it is fascinating that “we” reaches it’s all-time low around the time most people move out of their parents’ house, and not before).\nLastly, let’s take a look at the y axis: What is “Standardized Frequency”? We have an intuitive idea that higher means using the word more and lower means using it less. But this intuitive simplicity did not come easily - it had to be carefully constructed by the authors of the paper. Actually, “Standardized Frequency” is calculated using this formula:\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t understand any of this? That’s OK. We’ll cover methods of standardizing word frequencies in Chapter 14. For now, the point is this: Sometimes you have to do something complicated to make something simple. If Schwartz et al. had not performed these normalizations and transformations, “I” would likely be much higher frequency than “we” at all ages, and the story, which requires the viewer to focus on the slopes of the lines, would be much harder to appreciate."

    "text": "2.2 Engineer Your Aesthetics\nWe have just seen in Schwartz et al.’s beautiful data visualization that choosing to map the “frequency” variable to the y position aesthetic was not enough. In order to make the story clear, they had to carefully engineer the scale on which they were measuring frequency. In their case, this required some complicated standardization tailored to the particular statistics underlying their data. Often though, the solution is much more straightforward.\nThe remainder of this chapter outlines some common ways to engineer aesthetics that can help make a story clear and intuitive.\n\n2.2.1 Nonlinear Axes\nOften a simple log scale is enough to reveal a much clearer presentation of data. The following graph uses data from Buechel, Buffone, Slaff, Ungar, & Sedoc (2018), in which participants read news stories, rated their own empathy and distress after reading them, and then described their thoughts in their own words.\nThis visualization tells a story about the most and least common words in participant’s responses.\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ndistressed_texts_ordered &lt;- distressed_texts %&gt;% \n  # distressed frequency relative to non-distressed frequency\n  mutate(distressed_rel_freq = distressed_freq/nondistressed_freq) %&gt;% \n  # refactor in descending order\n  arrange(distressed_rel_freq) %&gt;% \n  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = word))\n\nbadplot1 &lt;- distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(word, distressed_rel_freq, label = word)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue3\", size = 1, alpha = .2) +\n    geom_text_repel(size = 3, \n                    data = filter(distressed_texts_ordered, distressed_rel_freq &gt; 4)) +\n    labs(title = \"Bad\",\n         x = \"Words, from least to most distressed\",\n         y = \"Distressed frequency / non-distressed frequency\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, 2)) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"red3\", hjust = 1, size = 20),\n          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15))\n\ngoodplot1 &lt;- distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(word, distressed_rel_freq, label = word, color = distressed_rel_freq &lt; 1)) +\n    geom_point(size = 1, alpha = .2) +\n    geom_text_repel(size = 3, \n                    data = distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% filter(distressed_rel_freq &gt; 3.6 | distressed_rel_freq &lt; .2),\n                    max.overlaps = 20) +\n    geom_hline(linetype = 2, yintercept = 1) +\n    labs(title = \"Good\",\n         x = \"Words, from least to most distressed\",\n         y = \"Distressed frequency / non-distressed frequency\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2^(-6:6)), trans = \"log2\", labels = ~MASS::fractions(.x)) +\n    guides(color = \"none\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"green3\", hjust = 1, size = 20),\n          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15))\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(goodplot1, badplot1)\n\n\n\n\nWhen plotting ratios, it is almost always a good idea to use a log scale (left). This way, the viewer can compare the largest and the smallest relative values. Without the log scale (right), the smallest values are squished into oblivion.\n\n\n2.2.2 Ordering Categorical Variables\nTake another look at the graph labeled “Good” above, and notice the ordering along the x axis. Words, on their own, are an unordered categorical variable. Nevertheless, in the context of a story, even unordered variables have an order. Ordering the categorical variable along the continuous variable of interest calls the distribution to attention and removes confusion.\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nbadplot2 &lt;- distressed_texts %&gt;% \n  # distressed frequency relative to non-distressed frequency\n  mutate(distressed_rel_freq = distressed_freq/nondistressed_freq) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(word, distressed_rel_freq, label = word, color = distressed_rel_freq &lt; 1)) +\n    geom_point(size = 1, alpha = .2) +\n    geom_text_repel(size = 3, \n                    data = distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% filter(distressed_rel_freq &gt; 9 | distressed_rel_freq &lt; .3),\n                    max.overlaps = 20) +\n    geom_hline(linetype = 2, yintercept = 1) +\n    labs(title = \"Bad\",\n         x = \"Words\",\n         y = \"Distressed frequency / non-distressed frequency\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2^(-6:6)), trans = \"log2\", labels = ~MASS::fractions(.x)) +\n    guides(color = \"none\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(color = \"red3\", hjust = 1, size = 20),\n          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15))\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(goodplot1, badplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Color Scales\nWe have already seen how a data visualizer can clarify a story by spatially ordering a categorical variable. A carefully tailored color scale can be an even more powerful communicator than an x or y axis. This is because color, even though it is usually treated as a single aesthetic, actually has many dimensions: luminosity, saturation, redness, blueness, etc.\nThe first step in choosing a color scale for any variable is to consider whether the thing being measured is diverging, sequential, or qualitative.\nDiverging scales measure something with a neutral center. This center is often represented by zero, but beware! Sometimes a neutral center is 4 on a seven point Likert scale (see “Agreement” below). When dealing with fractions, the neutral center is 1 (see “Relative Frequency” below).\nWhen applying diverging scales, keep in mind any associations people might have with the colors involved. For example, red should always be bad and blue/green good (see the plot in the previous subsection, in which red = distress = bad).\n\n\n\n\n\nSequential scales measure something that has an order, but no neutral center. Often, one side of the scale is at zero, so that the scale goes from nothing to something. In these cases, the appropriate color scale will represent amount with luminosity, where zero is the lightest (see “Frequency” and “Anxiety” below). This way, the lower amounts have lower contrast against the white background of the plot (if using a non-white plot background, make sure the low end of the scale matches).\nSometimes sequential scales are not measuring amount, as in “Weekdays” below. Weekdays have an order - from the beginning of the week to the end - but it would be a mistake to use a scale with one side a light color and the other a dark one, since that would suggest that Thursday is somehow ‘more’ than Wednesday. Likewise, there is no neutral center (there’s nothing neutral about Wednesday). In such case, the scale should go from one noticeable color to another. The chart below uses a palette reminiscent of sunset to give the impression of time passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have seen that many seemingly unordered variables should be ordered in the context of a story. Nevertheless, some variables are truly qualitative. In these cases, the color scale should maximize contrast between neighboring values without accidentally suggesting an order. For example, “Parts of Speech” below are all soft pastel colors. If some were darker or more saturated, it might suggest that there is an important difference between the groups.\nAgain, keep in mind any associations people might have with colors involved. For example, countries should be represented by colors that appear in their flags. This is of course sometimes difficult - all of the countries below have red in their flag, and all but China have blue and white. Nevertheless, try your best. The Wikipedia page for national colors was helpful in making the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Accent colors\nBecause color has many dimensions, it can sometimes be used to represent two scales at the same time. One common tactic is to use luminosity or saturation to emphasize certain values and de-emphasize others. Below, we have redrawn the relative frequency plot from earlier in this section to tell a story about two words in particular. By using accent colors, we remove distractors while maintaining the broader context of the story.\n\ndistressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(word, distressed_rel_freq, label = word, color = distressed_rel_freq &lt; 1)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(linetype = 2, yintercept = 1) +\n    scale_color_discrete(type = colorspace::lighten(c(\"#F8766D\", \"#00BFC4\"), .7)) +\n    geom_text_repel(size = 3, \n                    data = distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% filter(distressed_rel_freq &gt; 3.6 | distressed_rel_freq &lt; .2),\n                    max.overlaps = 20) +\n    guides(color = \"none\") +\n    new_scale_color() +\n    geom_point(aes(color = distressed_rel_freq &lt; 1), size = 3,\n               data = distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% filter(word %in% c(\"i\", \"we\"))) +\n    geom_text_repel(size = 4, data = distressed_texts_ordered %&gt;% \n                      filter(word %in% c(\"i\", \"we\")),\n                    max.overlaps = 20) +\n    labs(title = '\"We\" is a Sign of Distress',\n         x = \"Words, from least to most distressed\",\n         y = \"Distressed frequency / non-distressed frequency\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2^(-6:6)), trans = \"log2\", labels = ~MASS::fractions(.x)) +\n    guides(color = \"none\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 18),\n          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n          axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Aspect Ratios\nSimchon et al. (2021) investigated whether COVID-19 concern among New Yorkers resulted in higher or lower levels of certainty, as expressed in language on Twitter. Their story: Higher concern leads to greater expressions of certainty, since people use certainty as a coping mechanism. Here is their Figure 3, reproduced in three different aspect ratios:\n\nplot &lt;- covid_concern %&gt;% \n  mutate(z_cert = as.numeric(scale(cert)),\n         z_concern = as.numeric(scale(ny_net_concern))) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(z_cert, z_concern)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(name = if_else(name==\"z_cert\", \"Certainty\", \"NY Net Concern\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() +\n    geom_smooth(aes(date, value, linetype = name), \n                se=F, method = \"loess\", color = \"black\",\n                span = 1/3, method.args = list(degree=1)) +\n    ylab(\"Z-score\") + \n    xlab(\"Date\") + \n    scale_colour_grey() +\n    cowplot::theme_cowplot() + \n    labs(linetype =c(\"\"))\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(\n  cowplot::plot_grid(\n    plot + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)), \n    plot, \n    rel_widths = c(3, 4), labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"), label_colour = \"red3\"\n    ), \n  plot, \n  nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(2, 1), labels = c(\"\", \"C\"), label_colour = \"red3\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhich aspect ratio is the right one? A good aspect ratio is one that communicates the meaning of the variables in question. Since months are spread out over time (by definition), it makes sense to make the x-axis longer so that the viewer has the feeling of time passing as she scans it. But it shouldn’t be too wide, since the aspect ratio should also emphasize important differences in position (here, the positive slope of both lines). Something in between B and C seems appropriate.\n\nAs always, press the “View Source” button below to see the hidden code blocks in this section.\n\n\n\n\nBuechel, S., Buffone, A., Slaff, B., Ungar, L.
