  abstract = {In this paper, we study the linking patterns and discussion topics of political bloggers. Our aim is to measure the degree of interaction between liberal and conservative blogs, and to uncover any differences in the structure of the two communities. Specifically, we analyze the posts of 40 "A-list" blogs over the period of two months preceding the U.S. Presidential Election of 2004, to study how often they referred to one another and to quantify the overlap in the topics they discussed, both within the liberal and conservative communities, and also across communities. We also study a single day snapshot of over 1,000 political blogs. This snapshot captures blogrolls (the list of links to other blogs frequently found in sidebars), and presents a more static picture of a broader blogosphere. Most significantly, we find differences in the behavior of liberal and conservative blogs, with conservative blogs linking to each other more frequently and in a denser pattern.},

  pages={xix + 210-xix + 210},
  abstract={The psychological use of personal documents is traced from its uncritical beginnings at the turn of the century to its emergence in the last 20 years as a method in its own right. Its uses in molecular and molar research; in teaching; in suggesting new items for questionnaires; in inductive studies, often with the construction of typologies; in social psychology; etc. are examined. The place of the personal document in an idiographic rather than a nomothetic scheme is stressed: "Lawful happenings may be one-time events. Frequency is not a necessary test of validity." The forms of personal documents are presented with examples and discussion. Essentially, documents are reducible to autobiographies, questionnaire responses, verbatim recordings, diaries, letters, or expressive and projective productions. The evaluation of personal documents (65 pages) examines the case for and against their use. "It can be shown that{\ldots} critical tests of science are met by personal documents properly handled," and personal documents may be superior to actuarial methods by themselves in achieving the scientific goals of understanding, prediction, and control.

In all, the corpus includes four conversations from each of 64 young adults and manipulates the following variables: familiarity of speakers, eye contact between speakers, matching between landmarks on the participants' maps, opportunities for contrastive stress, and phonological characteristics of landmark names. The motivations for the design are set out and basic corpus statistics are presented. }

    abstract = {To what degree can we determine people's connections with groups through the language they use? In recent years, large archives of behavioral data from social media communities have become available to social scientists, opening the possibility of tracking naturally occurring group identity processes. A feature of most digital groups is that they rely exclusively on the written word. Across 3 studies, we developed and validated a language-based metric of group identity strength and demonstrated its potential in tracking identity processes in online communities. In Studies 1a–1c, 873 people wrote about their connections to various groups (country, college, or religion). A total of 2 language markers of group identity strength were found: high affiliation (more words like we, togetherness) and low cognitive processing or questioning (fewer words like think, unsure). Using these markers, a language-based unquestioning affiliation index was developed and applied to in-class stream-of-consciousness essays of 2,161 college students (Study 2). Greater levels of unquestioning affiliation expressed in language predicted not only self-reported university identity but also students’ likelihood of remaining enrolled in college a year later. In Study 3, the index was applied to naturalistic Reddit conversations of 270,784 people in 2 online communities of supporters of the 2016 presidential candidates—Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The index predicted how long people would remain in the group (3a) and revealed temporal shifts mirroring members’ joining and leaving of groups (3b). Together, the studies highlight the promise of a language-based approach for tracking and studying group identity processes in online groups.},

In this work, we study changes that occur in people’s language use after they share a specific piece of their identity: a depression diagnosis. To do so, we collect data from over five thousand users who have made such a statement, which we refer to as an identity claim. Prior to making a depression identity claim, the Reddit user’s language displays evidence of increasingly higher rates of anxiety, sadness, and cognitive processing language compared to matched controls. After the identity claim, these language markers decrease and more closely match the controls. Similarly, first person singular pronoun usage decreases following the identity claim, which was previously previously found to be indicative of self-focus and associated with depression. By further considering how and to whom people express their identity, we find that the observed longitudinal changes are larger for those who do so in ways that are more correlated with seeking help (sharing in a post instead of a comment; sharing in a mental health support forum). This work suggests that there may be benefits to sharing one’s depression diagnosis, especially in a semi-anonymous forum where others are likely to be empathetic.},

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

  abstract = "Emotion lexicons describe the affective meaning of words and thus constitute a centerpiece for advanced sentiment and emotion analysis. Yet, manually curated lexicons are only available for a handful of languages, leaving most languages of the world without such a precious resource for downstream applications. Even worse, their coverage is often limited both in terms of the lexical units they contain and the emotional variables they feature. In order to break this bottleneck, we here introduce a methodology for creating almost arbitrarily large emotion lexicons for any target language. Our approach requires nothing but a source language emotion lexicon, a bilingual word translation model, and a target language embedding model. Fulfilling these requirements for 91 languages, we are able to generate representationally rich high-coverage lexicons comprising eight emotional variables with more than 100k lexical entries each. We evaluated the automatically generated lexicons against human judgment from 26 datasets, spanning 12 typologically diverse languages, and found that our approach produces results in line with state-of-the-art monolingual approaches to lexicon creation and even surpasses human reliability for some languages and variables.

  abstract = {Word embeddings are vectorial semantic representations built with either counting or predicting techniques aimed at capturing shades of meaning from word co-occurrences. Since their introduction, these representations have been criticized for lacking interpretable dimensions. This property of word embeddings limits our understanding of the semantic features they actually encode. Moreover, it contributes to the {``}black box{''} nature of the tasks in which they are used, since the reasons for word embedding performance often remain opaque to humans. In this contribution, we explore the semantic properties encoded in word embeddings by mapping them onto interpretable vectors, consisting of explicit and neurobiologically motivated semantic features (Binder et al. 2016). Our exploration takes into account different types of embeddings, including factorized count vectors and predict models (Skip-Gram, GloVe, etc.), as well as the most recent contextualized representations (i.e., ELMo and BERT). In our analysis, we first evaluate the quality of the mapping in a retrieval task, then we shed light on the semantic features that are better encoded in each embedding type. A large number of probing tasks is finally set to assess how the original and the mapped embeddings perform in discriminating semantic categories. For each probing task, we identify the most relevant semantic features and we show that there is a correlation between the embedding performance and how they encode those features. This study sets itself as a step forward in understanding which aspects of meaning are captured by vector spaces, by proposing a new and simple method to carve human-interpretable semantic representations from distributional vectors.}

Drawing on a lexical approach to personality, the most commonly-used adjectives within narratives written by college students were identified using computerized text analytic tools. A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves.}

SMHD is a novel large dataset of social media posts from users with one or multiple mental health conditions along with matched control users. We examine distinctions in users{'} language, as measured by linguistic and psychological variables. We further explore text classification methods to identify individuals with mental conditions through their language.}

In comparing the personal worlds revealed by such documents, topical analysis is considered superficial. The content is analyzed, rather, by categories of form (complexity of expression and evaluation); change (in personal world); ideas of causation; values; plenitude (intensity of experience); direction (origin of values and actions); and distance (from objects and topics of interest and from conventional norms). The writer also considers the content symbolic of three complexes, apparently unrelated to these categories but suggested by the case. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = "{Current research highlights that ideology decisively affects political contestation concerning peace and security operations in European countries. In particular, recent studies suggest that party preferences on this issue follow a curvilinear distribution along the left-right axis, delineating a conflict between moderate and extreme parties. However, the impact of this cleavage on the use of strategic narratives to either support or criticize these missions requires more attention. This article aims to fill this gap by employing seeded latent Dirichlet allocation, a semi-supervised automated text analysis method, to analyze parliamentary debates on Italy's most significant troop deployments between 1994 and 2013. We expect to find that while moderates express a supportive narrative aimed at justifying the use of force, extremists attempt to delegitimize military interventions. Accordingly, we hypothesize that moderate parties emphasize more on the multilateral and humanitarian framework of a mission, while extremist parties focus more on its military means. The empirical findings largely confirm our hypotheses. By means of its method and results, the article contributes both empirically and methodologically to the debate on the party politics of military interventions in Europe.}",

  abstract = {Linguistic alignment (LA) is the tendency during a conversation to reuse each other's linguistic expressions, including lexical, conceptual, or syntactic structures. LA is often argued to be a crucial driver in reciprocal understanding and interpersonal rapport, though its precise dynamics and effects are still controversial. One barrier to more systematic investigation of these effects lies in the diversity in the methods employed to analyze LA, which makes it difficult to integrate and compare results of individual studies. To overcome this issue, we have developed ALIGN (Analyzing Linguistic Interactions with Generalizable techNiques), an open-source Python package to measure LA in conversation (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/align) along with in-depth open-source tutorials hosted on ALIGN's GitHub repository (https://github.com/nickduran/align-linguistic-alignment). Here, we first describe the challenges in the study of LA and outline how ALIGN can address them. We then demonstrate how our analytical protocol can be applied to theory-driven questions using a complex corpus of dialogue (the Devil's Advocate corpus; Duran & Fusaroli, 2017). We close by identifying further challenges and point to future developments of the field.},

We used language expressed on Twitter to characterize community-level psychological correlates of age-adjusted mortality from atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD). Language patterns reflecting negative social relationships, disengagement, and negative emotions—especially anger—emerged as risk factors; positive emotions and psychological engagement emerged as protective factors. Most correlations remained significant after controlling for income and education. A cross-sectional regression model based only on Twitter language predicted AHD mortality significantly better than did a model that combined 10 common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Capturing community psychological characteristics through social media is feasible, and these characteristics are strong markers of cardiovascular mortality at the community level. }

A common approach is to divide the number of cases observed in a sample by the size of the sample; sometimes small positive quantities are added to divisor and dividend in order to avoid zero estimates for types missing from the sample. These approaches are obvious and simple, but they lack principled justification, and yield estimates that can be wildly inaccurate. I.J. Good and Alan Turing developed a family of theoretically well‐founded techniques appropriate to this domain. Some versions of the Good‐Turing approach are very demanding computationally, but we define a version, the Simple Good‐Turing estimator, which is straightforward to use. Tested on a variety of natural‐language‐related data sets, the Simple Good‐Turing estimator performs well, absolutely and relative both to the approaches just discussed and to other, more sophisticated techniques.},

  abstract={We quantified the semantic content in adolescents’ descriptions of positive and negative life events and studied how these descriptions are related to the assessment subjective well-being (SWB) at two points in time. The semantic content of the descriptions was quantified by latent semantic analysis (LSA). LSA is a computational method based on algorithms stemming from computational linguistics, where a high dimensional semantic representation of words can be generated from co-occurrence of words in huge text corpora. We investigated if the semantic content of written autobiographical memories of positive and negative life events predicted traditionally ranked measures of SWB, i.e., self-reports of Positive and Negative Affect, and thus created semantic measures of SWB. Such measures can be used to investigate the relationship between semantic content and SWB, which could only indirectly be accomplished by the ranked data. Pupils wrote down positive or negative life events during the last 3 months and self-reported SWB. Four weeks later, participants were presented with their own description and asked to report current SWB. The results showed that the semantic representation predicted SWB and experimental conditions. The agreement between semantic and ranked measures supports the validity of the semantic scores. We argue that our proposed method for studying SWB provides new and essential information about well-being by the quantification of a richer set of information from adolescents’ own memories.

The systematic research conducted focused on social networks, social media, and the most employed techniques, feelings, and emotions were analyzed to find predecessors of a depressive disorder. Discussions on the research gaps identified aimed at improving the effectiveness of the analysis process, bringing the analysis close to the user’s reality. Twitter, Facebook, Blogs and Forums, Reddit, Live Journal, and Instagram are the most employed social networks regarding the identification of depressive mood disorders, and the most used information was text, followed by emoticons, user log information, and images. The selected studies usually employ classic off-the-shelf classifiers for the analysis of the available information, combined with lexicons such as NRC Word-Emoticon Association Lexicon, WordNet-Affect, Anew, and LIWC tool.

If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then r/N is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers nr (r = 1, 2, 3...), where nr is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (nr may be described as `the frequency of the frequency r'.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's characteristic' and Shannon's entropy'. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers nr but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},

	abstract = {How is knowledge about word meaning represented in the mental lexicon? Current computational models infer word meanings from lexical co-occurrence patterns. They learn to represent words as vectors in a multidimensional space, wherein words that are used in more similar linguistic contexts—that is, are more semantically related—are located closer together. However, whereas inter-word proximity captures only overall relatedness, human judgements are highly context dependent. For example, dolphins and alligators are similar in size but differ in dangerousness. Here, we use a domain-general method to extract context-dependent relationships from word embeddings: ‘semantic projection’ of word-vectors onto lines that represent features such as size (the line connecting the words ‘small’ and ‘big’) or danger (‘safe’ to ‘dangerous’), analogous to ‘mental scales’. This method recovers human judgements across various object categories and properties. Thus, the geometry of word embeddings explicitly represents a wealth of context-dependent world knowledge.},

  abstract = { Models that represent meaning as high-dimensional numerical vectors—such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), hyperspace analogue to language (HAL), bound encoding of the aggregate language environment (BEAGLE), topic models, global vectors (GloVe), and word2vec—have been introduced as extremely powerful machine-learning proxies for human semantic representations and have seen an explosive rise in popularity over the past 2 decades. However, despite their considerable advancements and spread in the cognitive sciences, one can observe problems associated with the adequate presentation and understanding of some of their features. Indeed, when these models are examined from a cognitive perspective, a number of unfounded arguments tend to appear in the psychological literature. In this article, we review the most common of these arguments and discuss (a) what exactly these models represent at the implementational level and their plausibility as a cognitive theory, (b) how they deal with various aspects of meaning such as polysemy or compositionality, and (c) how they relate to the debate on embodied and grounded cognition. We identify common misconceptions that arise as a result of incomplete descriptions, outdated arguments, and unclear distinctions between theory and implementation of the models. We clarify and amend these points to provide a theoretical basis for future research and discussions on vector models of semantic representation. }

Vocabulary tests were given to three groups of participants: highly successful adult‐onset learners of English, monolingual English speakers, and bilingual native speakers of English. Overall, the native speakers outperformed the non‐native speakers; however, the rate of native like achievement was remarkably high among the successful adult‐onset learners, which indicated that native level L2 vocabulary size and depth of word knowledge were attainable in adulthood. Factors that correlated with native level L2 vocabulary were: childhood caregivers' education, verbal ability and literacy in the native language, and interest in word learning and daily reading. The findings suggest that the lexicon may be the potentially most successful area of adult‐onset L2 learning.},

After completing personality questionnaires, participants provided their most recent text messages and indicated their relationship with the message recipient on several dimensions. Correlations between Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) categories and personality traits and relationship status were examined. There were significant correlations between certain LIWC categories and extraversion (e.g., personal pronouns), neuroticism (e.g., negative emotion words) and agreeableness (e.g., positive emotion words), suggesting that personality traits are displayed in how one texts. One of the defining features of texting – linguistic alterations (e.g., abbreviations) – varied as a function of both personality traits and relationship status. Overall, the results provide a snapshot of what text messages look like, and how they reflect the texter’s personality and the interpersonal context.}

  abstract = {Each relationship has its own personality. Almost immediately after a social interaction begins, verbal and nonverbal behaviors become synchronized. Even in asocial contexts, individuals tend to produce utterances that match the grammatical structure of sentences they have recently heard or read. Three projects explore language style matching (LSM) in everyday writing tasks and professional writing. LSM is the relative use of 9 function word categories (e.g., articles, personal pronouns) between any 2 texts. In the first project, 2 samples totaling 1,744 college students answered 4 essay questions written in very different styles. Students automatically matched the language style of the target questions. Overall, the LSM metric was internally consistent and reliable across writing tasks. Women, participants of higher socioeconomic status, and students who earned higher test grades matched with targets more than others did. In the second project, 74 participants completed cliffhanger excerpts from popular fiction. Judges' ratings of excerpt-response similarity were related to content matching but not function word matching, as indexed by LSM. Further, participants were not able to intentionally increase style or content matching. In the final project, an archival study tracked the professional writing and personal correspondence of 3 pairs of famous writers across their relationships. Language matching in poetry and letters reflected fluctuations in the relationships of 3 couples: Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Implications for using LSM as an implicit marker of social engagement and influence are discussed.},

  abstract = "{Representations from artificial neural network (ANN) language models have been shown to predict human brain activity in the language network. To understand what aspects of linguistic stimuli contribute to ANN-to-brain similarity, we used an fMRI data set of responses to n = 627 naturalistic English sentences (Pereira et al., 2018) and systematically manipulated the stimuli for which ANN representations were extracted. In particular, we (i) perturbed sentences’ word order, (ii) removed different subsets of words, or (iii) replaced sentences with other sentences of varying semantic similarity. We found that the lexical-semantic content of the sentence (largely carried by content words) rather than the sentence’s syntactic form (conveyed via word order or function words) is primarily responsible for the ANN-to-brain similarity. In follow-up analyses, we found that perturbation manipulations that adversely affect brain predictivity also lead to more divergent representations in the ANN’s embedding space and decrease the ANN’s ability to predict upcoming tokens in those stimuli. Further, results are robust as to whether the mapping model is trained on intact or perturbed stimuli and whether the ANN sentence representations are conditioned on the same linguistic context that humans saw. The critical result—that lexical-semantic content is the main contributor to the similarity between ANN representations and neural ones—aligns with the idea that the goal of the human language system is to extract meaning from linguistic strings. Finally, this work highlights the strength of systematic experimental manipulations for evaluating how close we are to accurate and generalizable models of the human language network.}",

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88\% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95\% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85\% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.}

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste. }

The availability of social media data spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive characteristics from behavioral data—language use—at large scale. Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human language use.},

  abstract = {Recently, research on inference methods has been actively conducted to use language models more effectively for studying natural language understanding. Inference in language models that use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is performed using classification tokens that convey information from the input sentences. The use of single-token inference method for inference does not involve the hidden state vector that contains relevant connection information between the words, which in turn limits the ability to infer semantic relationships. This study proposes a use all tokens (UAT) method that combines unused tokens to improve inference methods through a single token. The UAT method effectively combines hidden state vectors and ensembles the global information of sentences with the local information between words. When the Stanford natural language inference (SNLI) corpus was solved using DeBERTaV3large, compared to the existing single token inference method, the UAT method improved the precision of the neutral relationship by 4.3% (87.7% vs. 92.0%) and the recall of the entailment and contradiction relationship by an average of 2% (93.5% vs. 95.5%). The UAT method proposed in this study can be readily implemented in BERT-based language models, and it enhances the accuracy and F1-score, thereby improving the learning of semantic relationships between sentences.}

  abstract = {Linguistic and cultural changes are revealed through the analyses of words appearing in books. We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4\% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of ‘culturomics,’ focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.}

Two studies are presented that examine differences in knowledge representation among freshman and senior engineering students. The first study examines recall of mechanical devices and chunking of components, and the second examines whether seniors represent devices in a more abstract functional manner than do freshmen. The most prominent differences between these 2 groups involve their representation of the functioning of groups of electromechanical components and how these groups of components interact to produce device behavior. Seniors are better able to construct coherent representations of devices by focusing on the function of sets of components in the device. The findings from these studies highlight some ways in which the structure and content of mental representations of design knowledge differ during the early stages of expertise acquisition.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, stress has become a growing problem for society due to its high impact on individuals but also on health care systems and companies. In order to overcome this problem, early detection of stress is a key factor. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of text analysis in the detection of sentiment, emotion, and mental illness. However, existing solutions for stress detection from text are focused on a specific corpus. There is still a lack of well-validated methods that provide good results in different datasets. We aim to advance state of the art by proposing a method to detect stress in textual data and evaluating it using multiple public English datasets. The proposed approach combines lexicon-based features with distributional representations to enhance classification performance. To help organize features for stress detection in text, we propose a lexicon-based feature framework that exploits affective, syntactic, social, and topic-related features. Also, three different word embedding techniques are studied for exploiting distributional representation. Our approach has been implemented with three machine learning models that have been evaluated in terms of performance through several experiments. This evaluation has been conducted using three public English datasets and provides a baseline for other researchers. The obtained results identify the combination of FastText embeddings with a selection of lexicon-based features as the best-performing model, achieving F-scores above 80%.}

Abramson et al claims that an explanatory style in which bad events are explained by internal, stable, and global causes is associated with depressive symptoms. This style is claimed to be a risk factor for subsequent depression when bad events are encountered. A variety of new investigations of the helplessness reformulation are described that have employed 5 research strategies: cross-sectional correlational studies, longitudinal studies, experiments of nature, laboratory experiments, and case studies. Ss in these investigations included children, college students, poor women, depressed patients, and prisoners. Most of these studies involved the use of the Attributional Style Questionnaire and measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory and Multiple Affect Adjective Check List. These studies converge in their support for the learned helplessness reformulation. (120 ref)},

The Interactive Alignment Model posits that this convergence is obtained by a mechanism of priming that operates at all levels of linguistic representation. Under the model, priming is supposed to foster mutual understanding. Experimental research has confirmed that priming increases language production and comprehension ease. However, the influence of constraints caused by the medium of communication on alignment remains unexplored. In this paper, we look at structural alignment in face-to-face and synchronous text-based communication. In our study, we analysed the influence of different factors on structural alignment in two datasets, one of computer-mediated conversation and the other of spoken conversations, and found that the likelihood of structural alignment in both cases is determined by the same factors. However, when comparing the overall magnitude of structural alignment in the two datasets, we found a greater magnitude of structural alignment in text-based conversations. In our view, this result suggests that structural alignment is used to trade off the constraints of the text-based medium.}

This analysis confirms many current ideas regarding the neural organization of cognition, but also provides some new insights into the roles of particular brain systems in mental function. We further show that the same methods can be used to identify the relations between mental disorders. Finally, we show that these two approaches can be combined to empirically identify novel relations between mental disorders and mental functions via their common involvement of particular brain networks. This approach has the potential to discover novel endophenotypes for neuropsychiatric disorders and to better characterize the structure of these disorders and the relations between them.},

In this article, we propose an efficient algorithm and three pruning strategies to automatically build a word-level emotional dictionary for social emotion detection. In the dictionary, each word is associated with the distribution on a series of human emotions. In addition, a method based on topic modeling is proposed to construct a topic-level dictionary, where each topic is correlated with social emotions. Experiment on the real-world data sets has validated the effectiveness and reliability of the methods. Compared with other lexicons, the dictionary generated using our approach is language-independent, fine-grained, and volume-unlimited. The generated dictionary has a wide range of applications, including predicting the emotional distribution of news articles, identifying social emotions on certain entities and news events.},

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",

  abstract = {Task-solving in dialogue depends on the convergence of the situation models held by the dialogue partners. The Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering & Garrod, 2004) suggests that this convergence is the result of an interactive alignment process, which is based on mechanistic repetition at a number of linguistic levels. In this paper, we develop two predictions arising from the theory, along with two methods to quantify the known structural priming effects in the full inventory of syntactic choices found in text and speech corpora. (a) Under a rational perspective, we expect increased repetition in task-oriented dialogue compared to spontaneous conversation. We find within- and between-speaker priming in a corpus of spontaneous conversations, but stronger priming in task-oriented dialogue. (b) The Interactive Alignment Model predicts linguistic adaptation to be correlated with task success. We show this effect in a corpus of task-oriented dialogue, where we find a positive correlation of long-term adaptation and a quantifiable task success measure. We argue that the repetition tendency relevant for the high-level alignment of situation models is based on slow adaptation rather than short-term priming. We demonstrate that lexical and syntactic repetition are reliable and computationally exploitable predictors of task success.}

	abstract = {Typically, information is retrieved by literally matching terms in documents with those of a query. However, lexical matching methods can be inaccurate when they are used to match a user's query. Since there are usually many ways to express a given concept (synonymy), the literal terms in a user's query may not match those of a relevant document. In addition, most words have multiple meanings (polysemy), so terms in a user's query will literally match terms in irrelevant documents. A better approach would allow users to retrieve information on the basis of a conceptual topic or meaning of a document. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [Deerwester et al] tries to overcome the problems of lexical matching by using statistically derived conceptual indices instead of individual words for retrieval. LSI assumes that there is some underlying or latent structure in word usage that is partially obscured by variability in word choice. A truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate the structure in word usage across documents. Retrieval is then performed using the database of singular values and vectors obtained from the truncated SVD. Performance data shows that these statistically derived vectors are more robust indicators of meaning than individual terms. Section 2 is a review of basic concepts needed to understand LSI. In Section 3, a description of some of the advantages and disadvantages of LSI. The effectiveness of LSI has been demonstrated empirically in several text collections as increased average retrieval precision but a theoretical (and quantitative) understanding beyond empirical evidence is desirable. Section 4 describes some of the attempts that have been done in this direction. Finally, in Section 5 some applications of LSI.},

  abstract = { Why do connected users in online social networks express similar emotions? Past approaches have suggested situational emotion transfers (i.e., contagion) and the phenomenon that emotionally similar users flock together (i.e., homophily). We analyze these mechanisms in unison by exploiting the hierarchical structure of YouTube through multilevel analyses, disaggregating the video- and channel-level effects of YouTuber emotions on audience comments. Dictionary analyses using the National Research Council emotion lexica were used to measure the emotions expressed in videos and user comments from 2,083 YouTube vlogs selected from 110 vloggers. We find that video- and channel-level emotions independently influence audience emotions, providing evidence for both contagion and homophily effects. Random slope models suggest that contagion strength varies between YouTube channels for some emotions. However, neither average channel-level emotions nor number of subscribers significantly moderate the strength of contagion effects. The present study highlights that multiple, independent mechanisms shape emotions in online social networks. }

abstract = {Lifelong experiences and learned knowledge lead to shared expectations about how common situations tend to unfold. Such knowledge of narrative event flow enables people to weave together a story. However, comparable computational tools to evaluate the flow of events in narratives are limited. We quantify the differences between autobiographical and imagined stories by introducing sequentiality, a measure of narrative flow of events, drawing probabilistic inferences from a cutting-edge large language model (GPT-3). Sequentiality captures the flow of a narrative by comparing the probability of a sentence with and without its preceding story context. We applied our measure to study thousands of diary-like stories, collected from crowdworkers, about either a recent remembered experience or an imagined story on the same topic. The results show that imagined stories have higher sequentiality than autobiographical stories and that the sequentiality of autobiographical stories increases when the memories are retold several months later. In pursuit of deeper understandings of how sequentiality measures the flow of narratives, we explore proportions of major and minor events in story sentences, as annotated by crowdworkers. We find that lower sequentiality is associated with higher proportions of major events. The methods and results highlight opportunities to use cutting-edge computational analyses, such as sequentiality, on large corpora of matched imagined and autobiographical stories to investigate the influences of memory and reasoning on language generation processes.}

To facilitate this, we collect and release Hippocorpus, a dataset of 7,000 stories about imagined and recalled events. We introduce a measure of narrative flow and use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled events. Additionally, we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. Our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow, compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. In addition, while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory, imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. Finally, our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories (e.g., stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; Bartlett, 1932). Our findings highlight the potential of using NLP tools to study the traces of human cognition in language.},

In the current study, we address this question by investigating the association between existential threats and the certitude of societal discourse. According to appraisal theory, threats give rise to anxiety and perceptions of uncertainty; as such, it predicts that exposure to life-threatening events will increase expressions of uncertainty. An alternative possibility is that people will respond to threats by utilizing psychological compensation mechanisms that will give rise to greater expressions of certainty. Across two studies, we measured linguistic certainty in more than 3.2 million tweets, covering different psychological contexts: (i) the 15 major terrorist and school shooting events that took place between 2016 and 2018; (ii) the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with the idea of compensatory processing, the results show that levels of expressed certainty increased following intentional and natural existential threats. We discuss the implications of our findings to theories of psychological compensation and to our understanding of collective response in the age of global threats.}

Most existing methods focus on capturing the single emotional effect of words rather than the emotion distributions which are helpful to model multiple complex emotions in a subjective text. Meanwhile, automatic lexicon building methods are overly dependent on seed words but neglect the effect of emoticons which are natural graphical labels of fine-grained emotion. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion lexicon building framework that leverages both seed words and emoticons simultaneously to capture emotion distributions of candidate words more accurately. Our method overcomes the weakness of existing methods by combining the effects of both seed words and emoticons in a unified three-layer heterogeneous graph, in which a multi-label random walk (MLRW) algorithm is performed to strengthen the emotion distribution estimation. Experimental results on real-world data reveal that our constructed emotion lexicon achieves promising results for emotion classification compared to the state-of-the-art lexicons.},

  abstract={Online interactions increasingly involve complex processes of persuasion and influence. Compared to the long history and richness of persuasion studies in traditional communication settings, we have limited understanding of how people are influenced by others in online communications and how persuasion works in online environments. While it is common in online discussions that some comments are threaded under a specific thread, it is un-known whether and how the thread level affects its perceived persuasiveness. To explore this research inquiry, we collected and analyzed threaded discussions in Reddit's r/changemyview context. We found that the perceived persuasiveness of a comment fluctuates systematically from the top thread level to the most nested level. We conducted a semantic similarity analysis among adjacent comments in the threads examining how similar the comments are with respect to their content. Our results suggest that the first thread comment brings up a new idea or perspective, and the next comment matures it by adding new information to elaborate it, therefore, this comment is more likely to receive a delta point than the first comment. Additionally, this pattern continues onto the next comments. Implying that there is a common reasoning pattern in engaging in the threaded discussions in Reddit r/changemyview, our study sheds light on a comprehensive understanding of online participants' reasoning behavior in threaded discussions.},

    abstract = {Trustfulness {---} one{'}s general tendency to have confidence in unknown people or situations {---} predicts many important real-world outcomes such as mental health and likelihood to cooperate with others such as clinicians. While data-driven measures of interpersonal trust have previously been introduced, here, we develop the first language-based assessment of the personality trait of trustfulness by fitting one{'}s language to an accepted questionnaire-based trust score. Further, using trustfulness as a type of case study, we explore the role of questionnaire size as well as word count in developing language-based predictive models of users{'} psychological traits. We find that leveraging a longer questionnaire can yield greater test set accuracy, while, for training, we find it beneficial to include users who took smaller questionnaires which offers more observations for training. Similarly, after noting a decrease in individual prediction error as word count increased, we found a word count-weighted training scheme was helpful when there were very few users in the first place.},
